This project aims to design and prototype a Conversational AI that can respond to quick prompts with evidence-based practices in emergency response settings. The AI assists emergency personnel by providing rapid, reliable information to improve decision-making and response effectiveness during critical situations.

Features
>>>> Quick Response: Provides fast and relevant information based on       evidence-based practices.
>>>> Context Awareness: Understands the context of emergency scenarios to give appropriate responses.
>>>> User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive interface for ease of use by emergency responders.
>>>> Scalable and Adaptable: Can be scaled to include a wide range of emergency situations and updated with new data as practices evolve
